# Chore Master
---------------------------------------
This app is designed for a family to create and track chore completion on a regular calendar.  Its an elaborated Todo list exercise supporting multiple users via Firebase which offers the backend as a service. Firestore offers real time data watching so I can see when someone else updates a task and I can access the user data offered seemlessly from google user profiles.

Stack: Typescript | Firebase | Firestore | Material UI | React
